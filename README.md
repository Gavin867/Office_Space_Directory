## Application Summary

The Office Space Directory is an experiment with react components and using state to sort data retrieved from an api. With this application you can perform the following tasks:

1. Automatically query API when page loads or reloads
2. Search employees by first and last name.
3. Sort employees by last name either A-Z or Z-A.

## Installation

No installation is required for running the deployed version of the Big Kahuna Burger App. Simply click the '[Deployed Application Link]()' provided in the '[Location](#location)' section to get started.

When downloading and running the application locally, use the following steps:

2. Clone the repository to your computer and open the file in your code editor.
3. Open a new CLI/terminal instance in the Office Space Directory code file and run "npm init -y" to install the necessary node modules.
4. When all components are done loading, type "npm start" in the CLI. The application will automatically open in a new browser tab.

## Usage Instructions

1. To SEARCH for an employee, type the employee's first or last name.
2. To SORT employees by last name A-Z, click the 'down arrow' next to the 'Last' header in the table.
3. To SORT employees by last name Z-A, click the 'up arrow' next to the 'Last' header in the table.
4. To QUERY the API for new employee names, refresh or reload the page.

## Future Development

Additional goals and application features for future devlopment include:

- Re-theme Application to render and sort data for an actual purpose. This may actually take the shape of creating a new app entirely with a similar function. 
- Create a backend server, routes, and database to actually store data.
- Update styling to something
